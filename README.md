# MBI
* Morphological Building Index, extract `Buildings` from a high-resolution top view image(e.g. Quick Bird images) through a morphological method. 

* MBI is proposed by Prof. X. Huang, Wuhan University. \ The paper has been published on IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing in 2011. 

# Usage
* You can snip your neighbours from Google Map and use it as input. 
* Run the MBI.m in your MATLAB, and it will guide you to choose your input image.
* `Differential Mophological Spectrum`, as intermediate reuslts, will be output.
* Final results, the MBI index will be output.
