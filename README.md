# MBI
* Morphological Building Index, extract `Buildings` from a high-resolution top view image(e.g. Quick Bird images) through a morphological method. 

* MBI is proposed by Prof. X. Huang, Wuhan University. The paper has been published on [IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing in 2011](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6056582). 

# Usage
* You can snip your neighbours from Google Map and use it as input. (*.tif)
* Run the `MBI.m` in your `MATLAB`, and it will guide you to choose your input image.
* `Differential Mophological Spectrum`, as intermediate reuslts, will be output.
* Final results, the `MBI(Morphological Building Index)` will be output.
